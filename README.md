# AxoSynaptic

AxoSynaptic is a semantic launcher written in Vala that you can use to start
applications as well as find and access relevant documents and files by making
use of the Zeitgeist engine. It's based on Synapse by Michal Hruby and adapted
to MATE Desktop. It includes several fixes and enhancements not found in
Synapse.

This version of AxoSynaptic officially supports only Vala 0.16 and later.
